<p>Since the beggining of the financial markets, people have been trying to find every possible way to maximize a return on their investments. The golden question of, “can the stock market be predicted?” has been asked and studied for a long time. It seemed as if predicting the stock market was an impossible feat, and can still very much be so, however, with the introduction of machine learning into the financial world, it seems that the answer is getting closer and closer to being solved. Machine learning is revolutinizing the financial world, and is allowing investors to make more informed investment decisions in a space that is extremely complex. In this analysis, I will try to answer this question to the best of my abilities. I have created two models which will be compared and utilized to try and outperform a traditional buy and hold strategy, by using the models predicted values to make more informed and frequent trades.</p>

<p>First, we must import all of the required packages and specify the stock we will be analyzing. This program can be ran using any stock available on Yahoo Finance, however, for this analysis we will be looking specifically at Apple Inc.&nbsp;To run this analysis using a different stock, the variable ‘tick’ can be changed to any ticker.</p>

<h1>Visualizing the Data</h1>
<p>Before training any models I wanted to be able to visualize the stock in a way that you would see on the average trading platform along with some extra technical indicators. The chart gives you the option to toggle on and off two seperate moving averages, which are a smoothed trend line that represents the average value of a series of data points over a specified period, helping to identify overall direction. The data points are displayed using ‘candlesticks’, which visualize multiple datapoints related to the stock price over a given timeframe. These datapoints include the open, close, high, and low over a month-long timeframe.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Yearly Return Plot</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="yearly-returns">@yearly-returns</span> shows us the yearly return each year of Apple stock. We can see that since 2018, Apple has been a very good investment for long term holders. The only negative yearly returns that Apple has had since 2018, has been in 2018 and 2022, giving a negative return of -7.3% and -26.94% respectively. However, despite those negative returns, every other year has shown incredible gains, and has regained more than what was lost. The highest yearly return of Apple stock since 2018 was in 2019, where the stock showed a postive 89.59% gain, following that up with a 79.17% gain in 2020. At the time of making this analysis, we are still in the middle of 2024, so we cannot truly take into consideration the yearly return of 2024 shown here, however we can still keep it in mind that at the time of making this analysis, Apple is currently at a -2.59% return in 2024.</p>

<section id="model-creation" class="level1">
<h1>Model Creation</h1>
<p>In order to try and increase investment returns, we must first train a model that accurately predicts the stock’s closing prices. To do this, I trained two seperate models to see which one is more accurate. Both models were trained on data from January 2018 to February 2023, and tested with data from February 2023 to February 2024.The models that I used for this analysis are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).</p>
<p><strong>LSTM</strong>: is a type of neural network that retains important information over long sequences, enabling it to make predictions by selectively storing and forgetting nformation as needed.</p>
<p><strong>ARIMA</strong>: looks at past patterns in the data to make an educated forecast of the future values.</p>
<section id="stationary-test" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stationary-test">Stationary Test</h2>
<p>In order for the ARIMA model to be created, the time series data must be stationary. This means that the mean and standard deviation of the data must not vary across time. We can visualize the mean and standard deviation along with running a hypothesis test to see if the data is stationary or not.</p>

<p>The results of <span class="citation" data-cites="stat-test">@stat-test</span> shows that the data is not stationary. This can be seen where the rolling mean and standard deviation is not constant over the timeframe of the data. The p-value of the hypothesis test is greater than the confidence interval of 0.05, indicating that we cannot conclude that the data is stationary. So now we must difference the data to make it stationary so the ARIMA model can run properly.</p>

<p>To analyze the accuracy of the model, I looked at two different things. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the ‘Hit-Rate’. The RMSE tells us how close the predicted values were to the actual closing price, on average, in dollars. The ‘Hit-Rate’ tells us the percentage of times the predicted values fell within 1% of the actual closing price. As we see in <span class="citation" data-cites="arima-model">@arima-model</span>, this model was off by approximately $2.24, on average, and fell within 1% of the actual closing price about 65.13% of the time.</p>

<p>Similarly to the ARIMA model shown previously, we will be analyzing the LSTM model using the same forms of accuracy. The RMSE and ‘Hit-Rate’ of the model have been calculated and shown above. The LSTM model was off by approximately $2.4, on average, and fell within 1% of the actual closing price about 53.8% of the time.</p>

<h1>Results of Analysis</h1>
<p>In order to decide which model will be utilized to try and compete against the buy and hold strategy for a higher investment return, we must choose which form of accuracy is most important. Considering we are trying to maximimize how close we can get to predicting the actual closing price, the ‘hit-rate’ seems to be the best option for deciding which model to use in the simulation.</p>

<p>Now that we have concluded that the hit-rate is the most appropriate form of accuracy to choose the best model, we must compare the hit-rate of both models to see which one is higher. This function compares the two models to see which one has a higher hit-rate. The reason this must be calculated in the form of a function is that, if using a stock other than Apple, the ARIMA model may not be the more accurate model. This is why we must make this a function, so that the correct model gets chosen for each stock being tested.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="utilizing-model-results-to-increase-investment">Utilizing Model Results to Increase Investment</h2>
<p>Now that I have trained both models and selected the most accurate one, I must now utilize those predicted values to try and increase our investment returns. In order to do this I created a simulation which compares two strategies to see which one is more profitable. Both strategies will start at $10,000, run for approximately 1 year, and will not include tax or commissions on trades. The first strategy is a simple buy and hold strategy, which purchases the stock on day 1, and sells on the last day with no trades inbetween. The second strategy utilizes the predicted values to buy and sell according to what it predicts the stock will do.</p>

<p>After running the simulation on Apple stock, the model predictions were able to outperform the traditional buy and hold strategy by approximately $615. So to answer the question of, “Can we predict the stock market?”, the answer is… to an extent. The stock market is an extremely complex thing to try and predict, so being able to confidently say with certainty that you can predict the stock market is farfetched. The strategy I created for utilizing the model predictions is simple and has flaws. Although in this instance it provided an increase in return, it is not guranteed that it will work everytime, for every stock, in every timeframe. However, this analysis proves that machine learning can provide you with an edge in the market, and increase your investment returns.</p>

<span id="cb16-20"><a href="#cb16-20" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Since the beggining of the financial markets, people have been trying to find every possible way to maximize a return on their investments. The golden question of, “can the stock market be predicted?” has been asked and studied for a long time. It seemed as if predicting the stock market was</span>
<span id="cb16-21"><a href="#cb16-21" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>an impossible feat, and can still very much be so, however, with the introduction of machine learning into the financial world, it seems that the answer is getting closer and closer to being solved. Machine learning is revolutinizing the financial world, and is allowing investors to make more informed investment decisions in a space that is extremely complex. In this analysis, I will try to answer this question to the best of my abilities. I have created two models which will be compared and utilized to try and outperform a traditional buy and hold strategy, by using the models predicted values to make more informed and frequent trades.</span>

The chart gives you the option to toggle on and off two seperate moving averages, which are a smoothed trend line that represents the average value of a series of data points over a specified period, helping to identify overall direction. The data points are displayed using 'candlesticks', which visualize multiple datapoints related to the stock price over a given timeframe. These datapoints include the open, close, high, and low over a month-long timeframe.</span>

We can see that since 2018, Apple has been a very good investment for long term holders. The only negative yearly returns that Apple has had since 2018, has been in 2018 and 2022, giving a negative return of -7.3% and -26.94% respectively. However, despite those negative returns, every other year has shown incredible gains, and has regained more than what was lost. The highest yearly return of Apple stock since 2018 was in 2019, where the stock showed a postive 89.59% gain, following that up with a 79.17% gain in 2020. At the time of making this analysis, we are still in the middle of 2024, so we cannot truly take into consideration the yearly return of 2024 shown here, however we can still keep it in mind that at the time of making this analysis, Apple is currently at a -2.59% return in 2024.</span>

<span id="cb16-190"><a href="#cb16-190" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In order to try and increase investment returns, we must first train a model that accurately predicts the stock's closing prices. To do this, I trained two seperate models to see which one is more accurate. Both models were trained on data from January 2018 to February 2023, and tested with data from February 2023 to February 2024.The models that I used for this analysis are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).</span>

This function compares the two models to see which one has a higher hit-rate. The reason this must be calculated in the form of a function is that, if using a stock other than Apple, the ARIMA model may not be the more accurate model. This is why we must make this a function, so that the correct model gets chosen for each stock being tested.</span>

In order to do this I created a simulation which compares two strategies to see which one is more profitable. Both strategies will start at $10,000, run for approximately 1 year, and will not include tax or commissions on trades. The first strategy is a simple buy and hold strategy, which purchases the stock on day 1, and sells on the last day with no trades inbetween. The second strategy utilizes the predicted values to buy and sell according to what it predicts the stock will do. </span>

<span id="cb16-438"><a href="#cb16-438" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>After running the simulation on Apple stock, the model predictions were able to outperform the traditional buy and hold strategy by approximately $615. So to answer the question of, "Can we predict the stock market?", the answer is... to an extent. The stock market is an extremely complex thing to try and predict, so being able to confidently say with certainty that you can predict the stock market is farfetched. The strategy I created for utilizing the model predictions is simple and has flaws. Although in this instance it provided an increase in return, it is not guranteed that it will work everytime, for every stock, in every timeframe. However, this analysis proves that machine learning can provide you with an edge in the market, and increase your investment returns.</span>
